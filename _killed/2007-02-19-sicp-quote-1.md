I think that it&#8217;s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don&#8217;t think we are. I think we&#8217;re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don&#8217;t become missionaries. Don&#8217;t feel as if you&#8217;re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don&#8217;t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What&#8217;s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.

译文：我认为，在计算机科学中保持计算中的趣味性是特别重要的事情。这一学科在起步时饱含着趣味性。当然，那些付钱的客户们时常觉得受了骗。一段时间之后，我们开始严肃地看待他们的抱怨。我们开始感觉到，自己真得像是要负起成功地、无差错地、完美地使用这些机器的责任。我不认为我们可以做到这些。我认为我们的责任是去拓展这一领域，将其发展到新的方向，并在自己的家里保持趣味性。我希望计算机科学的领域绝不要丧失其趣味意识。最重要的是，我希望我们不要成为传道士，不要认为你是兜售圣经的人，世界上这种人已经太多了。你所知道的有关计算的东西，其他人也都能学到。绝不要认为似乎成功计算的钥匙就掌握在你的手里。你所掌握的，也是我认为并希望的，也就是智慧：那种看到这一机器比你第一次站在它面前时能做得更多的能力，这样你才能将它向前推进。
